# php-open-ai-mind
a php open ai console implementation.. but with some memory - so a mind really.

Doing mind/completion using OpenAI in PHP - easily configurable. (works in 02.2023)
Please add your credentials in OpenAI.php 

I wanted to have a quick PHP implementation so that you have your little own chatgpt, but using GPT-3 - It's very good stuff.

to run it php index.php

And then.. its just crazy

Define who's mind is that
And start asking questionm and follow up questions - I mean.. who needs real people to talk to right ?

Anyways it works with php7.2, using openAI API (on the date of 02.02.2023)

enjoy G@LFN.
